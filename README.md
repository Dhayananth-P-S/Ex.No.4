## Introduction  
Prompt engineering is the process of designing and refining prompts to get meaningful, accurate, and context-aware responses from AI systems.  
This experiment focuses on **advanced prompt types** that go beyond basic instruction-giving, using a **manufacturing automation scenario** as the use case.  

We will explore:  
1. Comparative Analysis Prompts  
2. Experiential Perspective Prompts  
3. Everyday Functioning Prompts  
4. Universal Prompt Structures  
5. Prompt Refinements – Prompt Size Limitations  

---

## Aim  
To write and evaluate prompts for the above prompt types using a manufacturing automation use case and compare their outputs using a chosen evaluation method (Rubrics).

## Theory  

### What is Prompt Engineering?  
Prompt Engineering is about creating effective instructions for AI models to get desired results.  
Advanced prompting techniques help generate **comparisons, perspectives, daily life analogies, structured outputs, and size-optimized responses**.

### Types of Prompts  

1. **Comparative Analysis Prompt**  
   - Compares two or more concepts, showing similarities and differences.  
   - Example: `"Compare and contrast deep learning and machine learning."`

2. **Experiential Perspective Prompt**  
   - Generates answers from a specific perspective or persona.  
   - Example: `"As a factory manager, describe the impact of predictive maintenance."`

3. **Everyday Functioning Prompt**  
   - Connects the topic to everyday life for better understanding.  
   - Example: `"Explain how IoT automation is similar to a smart home system."`

4. **Universal Prompt Structures**  
   - Generic prompt templates that can be applied to any topic.  
   - Example: `"Explain predictive maintenance in simple terms with an example."`

5. **Prompt Refinements – Size Limitations**  
   - Breaks large or complex prompts into smaller, manageable parts.  
   - Example: `"List 10 IoT devices used in manufacturing. Then provide 10 more."`

## Procedure  

### 1. Comparative Analysis Prompt
**Prompt:**  
`Compare and contrast manual manufacturing monitoring with IoT-based automated monitoring.`  

**Generated Output:**  

| Aspect                  | Manual Monitoring                         | IoT-Based Monitoring                  |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Data Collection       | Done manually by workers               | Automated using sensors and IoT devices |
| Accuracy              | Prone to human error                   | Highly accurate, real-time data |
| Response Time         | Delayed due to manual reporting        | Instant alerts and real-time dashboards |
| Cost                  | Higher labor cost                     | Lower operational cost after setup |
| Predictive Maintenance| Not possible or very limited           | Possible through data analytics |

---

### 2. Experiential Perspective Prompt
**Prompt:**  
`As a production supervisor, explain how predictive maintenance affects your daily work.`  

**Generated Output:**  
"As a supervisor, predictive maintenance helps me plan better. Instead of waiting for machines to fail, I get alerts in advance. This reduces unexpected breakdowns, avoids overtime labor costs, and allows smoother production scheduling."

---

### 3. Everyday Functioning Prompt
**Prompt:**  
`Explain predictive maintenance in manufacturing by comparing it to car servicing.`  

**Generated Output:**  
"Predictive maintenance in manufacturing is like taking your car for servicing based on sensor data rather than waiting for it to break down. Just like modern cars warn you about oil changes or engine problems, IoT devices in manufacturing notify engineers before machines fail."

---

### 4. Universal Prompt Structures
**Prompt:**  
`Explain the process of predictive maintenance step by step.`  

**Generated Output:**  
1. IoT sensors collect data from machines.  
2. Data is sent to a central monitoring system.  
3. AI algorithms analyze data for anomalies.  
4. Predictions are made about possible failures.  
5. Maintenance team is alerted for inspection.  
6. Preventive action is taken before breakdown occurs.

### 5. Prompt Refinements – Size Limitations
**Prompt:**  
`List 20 IoT devices used in manufacturing for automation and monitoring.`  

**Refinement:**  
`List 10 IoT devices first. Then give 10 more.`  

**Generated Output (First 10):**  
- Temperature sensors  
- Vibration sensors  
- RFID tags  
- Smart energy meters  
- Proximity sensors  
- Humidity sensors  
- Pressure sensors  
- Smart cameras  
- PLC controllers  
- Automated conveyor sensors  

**Generated Output (Next 10):**  
- Ultrasonic sensors  
- Load cells  
- Gas detectors  
- Flow meters
